            <p><strong>What is the course about?</strong></p>
            <p>The course focuses on learning algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems. It introduces concepts like recursion, iteration, backtracking, sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.</p>
            <p><strong>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures: Arrays, Trees (AVL, Red-Black), Graphs, Tries.</li>
                <li>Algorithms: Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort), Searching (Binary Search), Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</strong></p>
            <p>Real-time applications include navigation systems (shortest path algorithms), hierarchical data management (trees), and network optimization (spanning trees).</p>

            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <p><strong>What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</strong></p>
            <p>Problems include recursion (e.g., fractals), iteration (e.g., population growth), and backtracking (e.g., solving mazes).</p>
            <p><strong>What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</strong></p>
            <p>Space and time efficiency measure the performance of algorithms. They ensure optimal use of resources, crucial for scalability and effectiveness. Complexity classes like O(1), O(n), and O(nÂ²) help evaluate efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Takeaways from Design Principles:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Divide and Conquer: Solving problems by breaking them into smaller parts.</li>
                <li>Greedy Algorithms: Making the best choice at each step.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Programming: Solving complex problems by reusing solutions to subproblems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tree vs Graph Data Structures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trees are hierarchical and suited for structured data like file systems.</li>
                <li>Graphs are used for interconnected data like social networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Applications of Sorting and Searching:</strong></p>
            <p>Sorting optimizes database queries, while searching ensures efficient retrieval of information.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance of Graph Algorithms:</strong></p>
            <p>Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's are essential for navigation systems, and spanning tree algorithms optimize network design.</p>
