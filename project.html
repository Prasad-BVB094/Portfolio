            <h2>üìã Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Healthcare Management System (HMS) is a project that uses efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize healthcare operations. In a city, the health of citizens matters the most, so this project was chosen despite many other possible problem areas. HMS addresses four key areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emergency Incident Categorization ‚Äì</strong> Categorizing and prioritizing medical emergencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Appointment Scheduling ‚Äì</strong> Scheduling appointments for patients efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Supply Inventory Management ‚Äì</strong> Tracking and restocking of medical supplies.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Resource Allocation ‚Äì</strong> Optimizing the critical distribution of healthcare resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>HMS is built using algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Rabin-Karp string matching, QuickSort, Depth First Search, Priority Queues, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Union-Find to improve efficiency in real-time decision-making.</p>
            <p>The project is based on fundamental algorithmic problem-solving and data structures, referenced from textbooks such as Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ by Weiss and Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Module Description</h3>
            <p>The Medical Supply Inventory Management System ensures efficient tracking and restocking of essential medical supplies. It optimizes inventory management using hashing, tree-based search, and sorting techniques, ensuring smooth operations in hospitals and healthcare centers.</p>
            <h3>Key Algorithms Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hashing ‚Äì</strong> Enables quick lookup of inventory items.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST) ‚Äì</strong> Organizes inventory for efficient searches and updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection Sort ‚Äì</strong> Prioritizes items for restocking based on demand and urgency.</li>

            <h2>üîç Functionality Analysis</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Inventory Lookup (Hashing)</h3>
            <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Each inventory item is assigned a unique key using a hash function. Items are stored in a hash table for fast access. When checking stock, the system retrieves the item in O(1) average time.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Time Complexity: O(1) (average case), O(n) (worst case with collisions). Space Complexity: O(n) for storing items in the hash table.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Inventory Organization (Binary Search Tree - BST)</h3>
            <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Inventory items are stored in a BST, sorted by name or ID. Search, insert, and delete operations are performed efficiently. The tree remains balanced for optimal performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Time Complexity: O(log n) (balanced BST), O(n) (worst case). Space Complexity: O(n).</p>

            <h3>5.3 Restocking Prioritization (Selection Sort)</h3>
            <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Items are sorted based on urgency and demand using Selection Sort. The highest-priority items are identified for restocking. The sorted order ensures critical items are replenished first.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Time Complexity: O(n¬≤). Space Complexity: O(1).</p>
